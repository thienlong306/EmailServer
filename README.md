# EmailServer
### SIMULATE EMAIL SYSTEM WITH JAVA SOCKET
### Client-side functionality (with GUI):
- The functions of sending and receiving mail are similar to a simple mail client:
    - Send (including CC and BCC) to 1 or more email addresses: email content can be simply formatted (font size, font color, bold/italic, ...) and can embed images, attachments .
    - Receive
    - Reply; reply all
    - Mark spam emails
    - Schedule send
    - Delete
    - OpenFile
- Simulate how to categorize emails into groups: Inbox (for incoming and unread emails); Read (email has been read); Sent (for sent email); Spam (for emails marked as spam); Bin (for deleted emails; Drafts Offline (for draft emails you want to save locally).
- User information, data, change password
### Server-side functionality (no GUI):
- The server logs the client's login/logout process.
- The server can set and change the user's mailbox size. Default is 100 MB/user.
- The server can block or send email notifications to 1 user or all users.
